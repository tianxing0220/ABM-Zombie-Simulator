# ABM-Zombie-Simulator
Agent Based Modeling zombie simulator Java project. Original simulation is based on http://kevan.org/proce55ing/zombies/


Greens are humans, pinks are zombies, and yellows are panicked humans. The project starts with one zombie and a whole city of humans. Each agent faces one of four directions, in which they can either see other units or walls. When humans see zombies or panicked humans, they would turn into panicked humans. Zombies can infect humans and panicked humans when they are within range.
